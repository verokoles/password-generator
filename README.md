# Password Generator
## Purpose:
 * To create an application with JavaScript that contains a password generator. 
 * Any user can utilize to create their own unnique, random passcode that meets certain criteria.
 * It will run in the browser.

## Usage
 * CSS
 * HTML
 * JavsScript

 ## Steps
 An issue that would/t allow the code to run was the incorrect placement of the _____ outside of the 'for' loop. Variables created within the curly braces of a function only exist within that function's braces. Any reference to it outside of the function will cause the program to break because it can't find a variable with that name. being outside of the 'for' loop kept only drawing random groups of two, one, and zero characters. Once I placed them inside of the 'for' loop
